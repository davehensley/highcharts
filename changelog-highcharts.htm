<ul>

    <li>Added new option, <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#plotOptions.bubble.sizeByAbsoluteValue">bubble.sizeByAbsoluteValue</a>, to allow negative bubbles sizes to be based on the absolute value rather than a scalar difference from smallest to greatest.

    <li>Added new series option, <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#plotOptions.series.softThreshold">softThreshold</a>, to prevent showing subzero axis ticks for line series that consist of positive data only.</li>
