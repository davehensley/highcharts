This is simply a package that installs vanilla Highcharts, Highmaps and Highstock using Composer.
The purpose of this package is convenience (so you don't need to use npm or Bower if you already
use Composer for everything else).

To use this, simply run the following command inside your project directory:

``` bash
$ composer require davehensley/highcharts
```

You can also specify a specific version or range, e.g.:

``` bash
$ composer require davehensley/highcharts '4.*'
```

``` bash
$ composer require davehensley/highcharts '~4.2'
```

``` bash
$ composer require davehensley/highcharts 3.0.10
```

This software is free for non-commercial use. Otherwise, be sure to follow Highsoft's
