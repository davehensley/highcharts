		<title>Can't plot zero or subzero values on a logarithmic axis</title>

			This error occurs in the following situations:
			<ul>
				<li>If a zero or subzero data value is added to a logarithmic axis</li>
				<li>If the minimum of a logarithimic axis is set to 0 or less</li>
				<li>If the threshold is set to 0 or less</li>

		<title>Highcharts expects point configuration to be numbers or arrays in turbo mode</title>
		<description>
			This error occurs if the <code>series.data</code> option contains object configurations and the number
			of points exceeds the <code>turboThreshold</code>. It can be fixed by either setting the <code>turboThreshold</code>
			option to a higher value, or changing your point configurations to numbers or arrays. See <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#plotOptions.series.turboThreshold">turboThreshold</a>.

		<description>
			This error occurs if the <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/#renderTo">chart.renderTo</a> 
			option is misconfugured so that Highcharts is unable to find the HTML element to render the chart in.

		<title>String value sent to series.data, expected Number</title>
		<description>
			<p>This happens if you pass in a string as a data point, for example in a setup like this:</p>
			<pre>series: [{
	data: ["3", "5", "1", "6"]
}]</pre>
			<p>Highcharts expects the data values to be numbers. The most common reason for this is that data is parsed
				from CSV or from a XML source, and the implementer forgot to run <code>parseFloat</code> on the 
				parsed value.</p>
				
				
			<p>For performance reasons internal type casting is not performed,
			and only the first value is checked (since 2.3).</p>

		<title>Highcharts expects data to be sorted</title>
		<description>
			<p>This happens when you are trying to create a line series or a stock chart where the data is not
				sorted in ascending X order. For performance reasons, Highcharts does not sort the data,
				instead it is required that the implementer pre-sorts the data.</p>

		<title>Highcharts already defined in the page</title>
		<description>
			<p>This error happens the second time Highcharts or Highstock is loaded in the same page, so the <code>Highcharts</code>
			namespace is already defined. Keep in mind that the <code>Highcharts.Chart</code> constructor and all features
			of Highcharts are included in Highstock, so if you are running <code>Chart</code> and <code>StockChart</code> in combination, you 
			only need to load the highstock.js file. </p>

		<title>The requested series type does not exist</title>
		<description>
			<p>This error happens when you are setting <code>chart.type</code> or <code>series.type</code> to a series type
			this isn't defined in Highcharts. A typical reason may be that your are missing the extension file where the serires type
			is defined, for example in order to run an <code>arearange</code> series you need to load the <code>highcharts-more.js</code>
			file.</p>

		<title>The requested axis does not exist</title>
		<description>
			<p>This error happens when you set a series' <code>xAxis</code> or <code>yAxis</code> property to point to an axis that does not exist.</p>

		<title>Too many ticks</title>
		<description>
			<p>This error happens when you try to apply too many ticks to an axis, specifically when you add more ticks than the axis
				pixel length. In practice, it doesn't make sense to add ticks so densely that they can't be distinguished from each other. One cause of
				the error may be that you set a <code>tickInterval</code> that is too small for the data value range. In general, <code>tickPixelInterval</code>
				is a better option, as it will handle this automatically. Another case is if you try to set categories on a datetime axis, which will result
				in Highcharts trying to add one tick on every millisecond since 1970.</p>

		<title>Can't add object point configuration to a long data series</title>
		<description>
			<p>In Highstock, if you try to add a point using the object literal configuration syntax, it works only when the number of data points is 
				below the series' <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highstock#plotOptions.series.turboThreshold">turboThreshold</a>. Instead of the object
				syntax, use the Array syntax.</p>
