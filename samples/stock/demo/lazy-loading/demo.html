<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.highcharts.com/js/testing-stock.js"></script>

<div id="container" style="height: 500px"></div>

<div>In this example Highcharts' data grouping is turned off. Instead, new data 
	with a suitable resolution is loaded from the server every time the
	extremes of the x axis change.</div>



To do lazy-loading

- Range selector only running when choosing a smaller range. When choosing wider, it is limited to dataMin and dataMax
- When dragging the scrollbar, it jumps back until new data is loaded
- maxZoom has no effect
- loading data after Sep 30 is impossible though there is data on the server
- range selector inputs not reflecting actual data
- Show "loading" on the container before the dataset is first loaded. Move chart.loading up to namespace to allow it in a container before chart
is initiated?
